# LaTeX Templates

## Introduction

This template is adapted from the IEEE transaction. It is both compatible with pdfLaTeX and XeLaTeX. URSI 2022 has provided a template for using the IEEE transaction template to write the two-page summary (see [here][ursi]). According to the official example, we design this template for providing more supports.

The `NRSMRev.cls` is designed based on `IEEEtrans.cls`. This branch would provide both files. We make the following adaptions for supporting more features:

* **Introduce `hyperref`**: it will add hyperlinks to all referring tags. We provide options to disable this feature.
* **Support some packages**: we have integrate some useful packages, including AMS math packages, `graphicx`, `dsfont`,  `bm`, `tabularx`, `xcolor`, `subfloat`, `float`, `multicol`, `algorithm`, `listings`, `ntheorem`, `enumitem`, and `placeins`.
* **Add a pdf password**: This feature only supports XeLaTeX. It will enable you to add an owner password and a viewer password to the produced pdf file. 

## All options

The following options should only be enabled when using the class, like

```latex
\documentclass[option]{NRSMRev}
```

| Option | Description | Counter option | Default state |
| -----  |   -----     |      -----     |  -----  |
| `color`  | Add colors to all links. It would not influence the figures. | `gray` | Disabled |
| `draft`  | Use the draft mode of `IEEEtrans`, all figures would be replaced by placeholders, and the codes in the text would be skipped. | - | Disabled |
| `fleqn`  | Make the equations left-aligned. | `cteqn` | Disabled |
| `refNum` | Whether to add the section number to the reference section. This option may cause problem if you place appendices before the reference. | `norefNum` | Disabled |

The following options could be assigned in both the class options and the following command:

```latex
\NRSMsetup{
  option1=value1,
  option2=value2, ...
}
```

| Option | Description | Default value |

| `codeStyle` | The style of the codes created by `listings`, could be either `box` or `default`. | `default` |
