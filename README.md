# LaTeX Templates

## Introduction

This template is adapted from the Springer Verlag Global LaTeX2e Support for Multi-authored Books (SVMULT). It is both compatible with `pdfLaTeX` and `XeLaTeX`. The documentation of the original SVMULT can be found [here :link:][svmult-doc]. According to the official example, we design this template for providing more supports.

In this package, we mainly make the following three modifications:

1. **Fix the compatibility issues**: Fix a severe compatibility issue between `svmult`, `natbib`, and `hyperref`

2. **Support more packages**: Provide a `svmultrev.cls` for incorporating some quite widely used packages, including:

   | Package                                   | Usage                                                        |
   | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `hyperref`                                | Add hyper links to all references and titles. Will only works if specified `hyper` option. |
   | `type1cm`, `newtxtext`, `newtxmath`         | Specify the main font as the times fonts.                  |

   | `float`, `subfig`, `stfloats`, `placeins` | Provide complicated float environments for placing tables and figures. |
   | `multicol`                                | Provide the multi-column text feature.                       |
   | `algorithm`, `algorithmic`                | Provide environments for describing algorithms.              |
   | `siunitx`                                 | Provide commands about SI Units.                             |

3. **Add a pdf password**: This feature only supports XeLaTeX. It will enable you to add an owner password and a viewer password to the produced pdf file. 

## All options

The following options should only be enabled when using the class, like

```latex
\documentclass[option]{svmultrev}
```

|  Option  |  Description  |  Counter option  |  Default state  |
| :------: | ------------- | :--------------: | --------------- |
| `hyper`  | Add colors to all links. It would not influence the figures. | `nohyper` | Disabled |
| `draft`  | Use the draft mode of `article`, all figures would be replaced by placeholders, and the `hyperref` package (if used) will also work in draft mode. | `final` | Disabled |
| `natbib` | A flag. When configured, use the `natbib` package to provide references. | `nonatbib` | Enabled |
