# LaTeX Templates

## Introduction

This template is adapted from the Springer Class for Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LLNCS).. It is both compatible with `pdfLaTeX` and `XeLaTeX`. The newest LLNCS class can be found on CTAN (see [here :link:][llncs]). The documentation of the original LLNCS can be found [here :link:][llncs-doc]. According to the official example, we design this template for providing more supports.

In this package, we mainly make the following three modifications:

1. **Fix the compatibility issues**: Fix a small compatibility issue between the original `llncs.cls` and the `amsmath` package. The `amsmath`needs to be loaded before the definition of `\vec`.

2. **Support more packages**: Provide a `llncsrev.cls` for incorporating some quite widely used packages, including:

   | Package                                              | Usage                                                        |
   | :--------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
   | `hyperref`, `hypcap`                                 | Add hyper links to all references and titles. Will only works if specified `hyper` option. |
   | `mfirstuc`                                           | Provide title case features. |

   | `siunitx`                                            | Provide commands about SI Units.                               |
   | `url`                                                | Provide features about URLs.                              |

3. **Add a pdf password**: This feature only supports XeLaTeX. It will enable you to add an owner password and a viewer password to the produced pdf file. 

## All options

The following options should only be enabled when using the class, like

```latex
\documentclass[option]{llncsrev}
```

|  Option  |  Description  |  Counter option  |  Default state  |
| :------: | ------------- | :--------------: | --------------- |
| `hyper`  | Add colors to all links. It would not influence the figures. | `nohyper` | Disabled |
| `draft`  | Use the draft mode of `article`, all figures would be replaced by placeholders, and the `hyperref` package (if used) will also work in draft mode. | `final` | Disabled |
| `authoryear` | A flag. When configured, use an `authoryear` style bibliography style. | `numcit` | Disabled |

The following options could be assigned in both the class options and the following command:

```latex
\LLNCSRevSetup{
  option1=value1,
  option2=value2, ...
}
```

|       Option      |  Description  |  Default value  |
| :---------------: | ------------- | --------------- |
| `title`           | The title of the chapter. It only appears in the PDF meta data. | `Draft for Springer Bookï¼Œ LLNCS Template` |
| `author`          | The name of the authors. It only appears in the PDF meta data. | `Yuchen Jin` |

| `keywords`        | The keywords of the article. It will appears in the PDF meta data and the abstract. It can be configured by `\keywords` automatically. | ` ` |
| `ownerPass`       | This option is only compatible with `XeLaTeX`. It is the owner password. It would be required if anyone wants to edit the produced pdf file. | ` ` |
| `userPass`        | This option is only compatible with `XeLaTeX`. It is the user password. It would be required if anyone wants to open the produced pdf file. | ` ` |

Notes:

1. The title case means that the first character of all words are capitalized, except for these words: "a", " an", " the", " and", " as", " but", " for", " if", " nor", " or", " so", " yet", " at", " by", " in", " of", " off", " on", " per", " to", " up", " via", " with".
